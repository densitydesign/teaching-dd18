The studio-course is structured in different moments, on a path that explores different dimensions of data analysis, information and communication design. Students will start by representing and visually explaining statistical models and algorithms, designing a first visual synthesis. At this stage, to ensure a correct relationship with the data, statistical notions and tools are introduced. In the following steps students will focus on inquiring the controversies around selected topics by using unstructured data and information produced and shared by non-institutional organizations, communities, collective entities or individuals and activists via the Internet. Finally students will design a (data) experience with the aim of engaging a broad public in understanding the complexity of the issues at hand.

While in the last decade the concerns were mainly user-centered, thinking mainly to the outcome for the individual (e.g. privacy loss), in the last few years we have seen how all these technologies are having consequences on society as a whole. Home sharing services are reshaping the real estate market, and perhaps cities. Social networks have been tweaked to influence and push propaganda in the democratic processes, or misused to organize mobs against minorities. Biometrics data, useful for unlocking the screen of our phones, brings also racial biases. Self-Driving cars, approaching in the near future, will impact on urbanization as well.

These issues do not have clear and unambiguous solutions and generate dense and complex debates that interweave alliances and oppositions, involving many different actors through digital conversations. As communication designers we can - and we should - contribute to the understanding of these phenomena and orienting possible (re)actions. As complex and controversial problems can not be faced by a single actor, we can represent and share the debate that defines and nourishes them so that any stakeholder can find its own position.
The course requires to identify the most suitable communication languages ​​and tools, both digital and physical, to exploit their specific potential and to synthetize all the competences acquired.

Within the Final Synthesis Design Studio converge competences and tools developed into the DensityDesign research lab. With data visualization as the main language, it evolves as a communication and narration device as well as a way to share knowledge, methods and results.

# Teaching Aims
At the end of the course, students will have gained:
1. Knowledge in the data visualization, information visualization, information design disciplines, and the role of communication design;
2. Knowledge and use of the visual variables and application of communication design to visualization of data and information;
3. Knowledge on tools for data manipulation (Excel, OpenRefine) and for the creation of visual structures (RAWGraphs, Gephi);
4. Knowledge on data harvesting/scraping (Web Scraper Chrome Extension) and data collection through APIs;
5. Knowledge on  basic concepts from statistics and softwares for their application (R);
6. Knowledge of the rhetorical-argumentative figures (especially those based on analogy and metaphor).
