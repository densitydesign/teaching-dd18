# Visual Explanations

As communication designers, we are often requested to focus on translating data into something visual: from the simplest barchart to the most complex data visualization. But how was that data product created? Or better, which tools were used to design it?

In translating a phenomenon into useful and comprehensible data, the final output results from a long transformative process from original observations, and statistical methods play a key role.
Statistical methods make it possible to analyze and make sense of observations  — at known prices: each method has strengths and weaknesses.

However, they are often used as magic boxes created by a machine: you put your data in them, and get another dataset suitable for your needs. But what happened inside them? How can we help designers’ understanding that algorithms are instead human original creations with just the perfunctory and routinary computations made by the machine?

During the first month of the course, students studied eight popular data analysis algorithms  to produce a poster visually explaining how they work, their strengths and weaknesses.
