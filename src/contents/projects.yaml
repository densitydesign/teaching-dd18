    desc: "Image is a compelling visual medium for depicting real people,
          communicating truths, and creating new narratives. Additionally, when
          coupled with climate change, its emotionally powerful images can raise
          audience awareness of the issue. And how, precisely, “ClimateVisuals” -
          the climate image library, is a powerful platform built on trustworthy
          compass points. In this project, we analyse using a selection of images
          from ClimateVisuals"

    desc: "The report looks into how major fast food companies in the U.S. present
      sustainability on their websites. The food sector is accountable for 34%
      of CO2 emissions, and the U.S. is a major contributor. Thus, the aim of
      the study is to discover common patterns or distinct formulas in the
      digital communication tactics used by these corporations in relation to
      their representation of environmental impact. The study also aims to
      detect instances of greenwashing (deceptive claims of environmental
      responsibility) by analysing the history of the website, including when
      the sustainability page was introduced and the images and keywords used on
      it. The Green Recipe Archive The ongoing climate change can be considered
      as one of the major topics of today. Thus, many companies have been
      motivated to align their businesses to the new green values. As one of the
      significant generators of CO2 emissions, fast food companies are trying to
      change the current statistics as well. In doing so, they've started
      talking about environmental consciousness: by using a website as an
      official communication tool, they can at ease reach an audience and spread
      their green narratives. This archive is therefore structured as a
      collection of these green narratives, in which real examples of sentences
      extracted from their websites can be consulted and explored. A special
      attention was paid to highlighting the strategies and common patterns
      behind them: the “ingredients” of their “green recipes”."

    desc: "With the threat of climate change growing day by day, our responsibility
          to care for our planet is more impor- tant than ever. This is where
          reforestation comes into play. The topic is connected to a range of
          practices adapted to solving environmental problems, from restor- ing
          habitats to replanting acres of damaged woodland. However, due to these
          varying methods, a branching can- opy of terms emerges. The aim of this
          investigation is to determine how these practices are connected, their
          growth over time, and which factors affect our associations to them. To
          conduct this analysis, three platforms were mainly used, Wikipedia, Google
          Trends and Google Images, to collect data and build findings. The
          following research expands on reforestation terms to find related topics
          using Wikipedia, allowing for the creation of network graphs which
          highlight connections and clusters between the data gathered. Google
          Trends was used to reveal the search trends of terms over time. Their
          popularity and how it fluctuates is shown, along with events and patterns
          that cause these changes. By ana- lysing Google Image results, the way
          terms are visually portrayed is investigated. This reveals usage of common
          tropes they share, or imagery unique to them. Plant Forward This is a
          website that takes its cue from the research done on the topic of
          reforestation named Lost in Woods, from the images found for that research
          in fact an archive was designed to understand how the images represent
          reforestation. Specifically we sorted the images according to how old the
          plant within was visually, we then presented this order in a continuous
          morphing between the images, thus creating the illusion of a plant growing
          with the passage of time. alongside this visualization we placed a sort of
          timeline so that at a glance we could estimate how many images represented
          the various stages of tree growth. The core of the site is then
          accompanied by an initial scrollytelling that explains the theme of the
          work and the logic of sorting the images, and an about page that explains
          the research methodologies applied to this project."

    desc: "The buzz around fast fashion retailers, how sustainable and ethical they
      are, has been circulating in the media for quite a while. Companies like
      Shein, H&M, Zara, Mango, etc. are more and more frequently criticised by
      green activists and conscious consumers, especially of younger
      generations. However, these brands’ popularity does not seem to fall down,
      because of their affordability, readiness and fashionability. The issue
      was observed from three different perspectives: a more general point of
      view (observing Google Search results to track what are the most discussed
      topics online and how often they relate directly to the biggest fast
      fashion retailers), then the companies’ side (how they changed their
      policies, visual and verbal rhetorics over time in response to the
      sustainability trends) and finally the customers’ take (analysing
      user-generated-content on YouTube and especially video “hauls” to
      understand what they can tell about the issue in general and consumer
      behaviour patterns). Found in Fast Fashion Factories Fashion is one of the
      most labour-dependent industries, but many companies have decided to
      bypass production completely, by switching their homeland production with
      contracted-out manufacturing, especially in low-income countries. This
      way, all of the processes ended up being submerged, making it very hard to
      imagine that the clothes we see in stores were once made by someone,
      somewhere far away. Found in Fast Fashion Factories is a web archive that
      collects 6683 photos that were posted on Google Maps with the geolocation
      of 1000 garment factories around the world. By republishing this data,
      FFFF makes everyday objects, people and spaces that are usually unseen,
      available for people to consult. The goal is to get closer to the reality
      of these places, to share a different (hopefully, more candid) perspective
      about them, and restore the discarded physicality of people and processes
      behind the fashion industry."

    desc: "Innovations in the digital sphere have made Artificial Intelligences new
      actors of the communication landscape. What if txt-to-img AIs were in
      charge of producing climate change visuals? This report uses Stable
      Diffusion – an open source txt-to-img AI – to question the relationship
      between humans and machines in the context of climate change imagery.
      Specifically, it focuses on Stable Diffusion's training set (images
      provided to Ai), latent space (image generation process), and outputs (new
      images generated by Ai). Therefore, the 3 research questions are - How are
      climate change actors and actions depicted in Stable Diffusion’s training
      set? - What can latent space tell us about Stable Diffusion’s
      interpretations of climate change? - How does Stable Diffusion represent
      people and their actions related to climate change in generated images?
      EYE TO AI: Exposing human biases on climate change through AI The future
      has arrived: text-to-image AI is here, we can now generate images from
      simple text descriptions. Tools like Dall-e and Stable Diffusion are
      rapidly spreading, but behind the facade of a simple and fun technology
      there are some significant ethical concerns that aren't known to the
      public. Eye to Al brings to light the biases and stereotypes on climate
      change that txt-to-img AI inherits from society, using the machine itself
      as a tool to expose its inherent issues while joining the wide debate on
      the myth of neutrality in technology. Testing Stable Diffusion, we
      generated 500 images starting from prompts that ranged among climate
      change related topics and defined clusters of biases based on observed
      patterns. The result is explorable through the website in the bias
      catalogue and the prompt explorer."

    desc: "During these last decades, the automotive industry seems to have taken
      some steps towards “sustainability”, by increasing fuel efficiency and
      developing hybrid and “emission-free” powertrains. Despite this, it is
      still often accused of greenwashing, since many brands still don’t plan to
      cease the production of internal combustion engine vehicles nor to stop
      collaborating or lobbying with fossil fuel companies, even when their
      line-up is “fully electric”. And when it comes to batteries, there lays
      the problem of mining rare-earth metals. The report is the result of an
      investigative effort on the communication strategies that car brands adapt
      to make their models appear more “eco-friendly” in their video
      advertisements, starting from 90 different best selling vehicles in Europe
      in 2021—30 for each major propulsion type. Automotifs. A collection of
      recurring communication strategies related to sustainability in car
      adverts on YouTube Automotifs is a collection of sustainability-related
      communication strategies found in car adverts on YouTube: today, most car
      brands tend to use communication strategies that could be interpreted both
      as a subtle way to associate their models and image to the concept of
      sustainability and as typical advertising efforts. Thus, they could be
      leveraged not to just persuade people into buying a new model, but to also
      promote a cleaner image of both themselves and their products. The website
      reveals them in a de-contextualised and straightforward manner by focusing
      on their peculiarities through supercuts and video collages, so that car
      owners, potential customers or people interested in mobility, energy
      transition and related topics can examine this content with a critical
      perspective, reflect on, or just form their opinion on it."
