### Report — Website
# Data as artefact
In the second phase of the course, students learn how to use online data to study social and cultural phenomena. Online devices such as social media and search engines mediate our access to information, playing a crucial role in organizing, ordering, and ranking content. Confronted with society’s inability to face the climate crisis, the question of what is deemed visibility online (and what is not) gains even more urgency. In this phase, students explored aspects of the climate crisis by finding ways to repurpose digital platforms and online services. 
In a question-driven process, each group explored a climate-related issue in a specific online space, designed a series of protocols for data collection and analysis, and produced research findings using data visualizations. In the process, students engaged with issues related to web-based data, from understanding platform biases to the uncertainty and incompleteness of available data. 
The outcomes of this phase are printed reports offering multiple perspectives on the role of online devices in mediating information about the climate crisis. 

# Data publics

The last phase of the course is closely related to the second one. Students were asked to identify one relevant aspect from their initial explorations and translate it into a digital experience or, better, a discursive communication artifact that exposes, reveals, and makes visible critical aspects of the topics to a specific audience. Students explore designerly means for republishing data to create situated meanings, primarily exploring the design of collections through archives and catalogs.
Through the process, students reflected on the meaning and agency of the notion of “the public”: how different groups mobilize around various issues and how data can play a central role in forming different publics. Students were also encouraged to recognize the political role their design practices play with technology and how they impact society.
The result of the phase is a digital narrative in website format designed to illustrate students’ views on the chosen topic. By leveraging digital and interactive techniques, each website is a digital experience illustrating a peculiar view on the broader topic of how humans are dealing with the climate crisis.
