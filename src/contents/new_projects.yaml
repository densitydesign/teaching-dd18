    report: 
      - title: "The Green Fever"
        desc: "The report looks into how major fast food companies in the U.S. present
      sustainability on their websites. The food sector is accountable for 34%
      of CO2 emissions, and the U.S. is a major contributor. Thus, the aim of
      the study is to discover common patterns or distinct formulas in the
      digital communication tactics used by these corporations in relation to
      their representation of environmental impact. The study also aims to
      detect instances of greenwashing (deceptive claims of environmental
      responsibility) by analysing the history of the website, including when
      the sustainability page was introduced and the images and keywords used on
      it."
    website: 
      - title: "The Green Recipe Archive"
        desc: "The ongoing climate change can be considered
      as one of the major topics of today. Thus, many companies have been
      motivated to align their businesses to the new green values. As one of the
      significant generators of CO2 emissions, fast food companies are trying to
      change the current statistics as well. In doing so, they've started
      talking about environmental consciousness: by using a website as an
      official communication tool, they can at ease reach an audience and spread
      their green narratives. This archive is therefore structured as a
      collection of these green narratives, in which real examples of sentences
      extracted from their websites can be consulted and explored. A special
      attention was paid to highlighting the strategies and common patterns
      behind them: the “ingredients” of their “green recipes”."
